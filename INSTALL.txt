Dependencies:
- A C++ compiler, both gcc and clang should work. Recent versions are required, with support for c++14.
- CMake >= 2.6 for building
- Bio++ libraries: bpp-core, bpp-seq, bpp-phyl (version >=2.4 required). Can be installed from GitHub (https://github.com/BioPP) or from precompiled packages.
- The boost-iostreams library
- The Threads library (usually provided with the c++ compiler installation)
- The blas and cblas libraries (Atlas library), required for zipHMM.
- The SimpleZipHMM library, a fork from Mailund's orginal zipHMM library. Can be retrieved from https://gitlab.gwdg.de/molsysevol/simple-ziphmm. Install using:
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local (for a local install)
  make
  make install

Installation of iSMC:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -DUSE_LIBSIMPLEZIPHMM=true (for a local install)
make
make install

It is possible to generate a static executable, with all dependencies imbeded, so that it can be copied on a remote computer / cluster:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -DBUILD_STATIC=ON
make
make install

The 'ismc' executable will then be copied in $HOME/.local/bin .

On a standard linux workstation, iSMC takes ~ 2 minutes to compile and install once all dependencies are met.
